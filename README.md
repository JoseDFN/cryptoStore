# CryptoStore

CryptoStore is a web application designed to simulate a simple e-commerce platform where users can add products to a table, calculate totals dynamically, and generate invoices. The application demonstrates the use of Web Components, dynamic event handling, and local storage for persisting invoice data.

- **Real-time Updates:** The invoice summary (subtotal, tax, and total) updates in real time whenever products are added or removed.  
- **Delete Products:** Products can be removed from the table, and the invoice summary recalculates automatically.  
- **Invoice Generation:** Users can generate and save invoices, including customer and product details.  
- **Local Storage:** Invoices are saved locally to allow for persistence.
